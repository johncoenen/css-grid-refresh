      <p>The order of items in the source does not matter. However, they need to be child elements of the element declared as grid. This example has content and ads. The ads are placed beneath the source. Grid is used to show the ads between sections. Even though it is below the content sections in the source!</p>

        <b>
          Accessibility Note:Logical order should be set in the source. In other words, don't use grid properties to set the logical order of a document.

       Goldberg, a San Francisco native who studied engineering at University of California, Berkeley, is, according to his estate, the only person whose name is used as an adjective in the dictionary. As early as 1931, the Merriam-Webster Dictionary defined “Rube Goldberg” as “accomplishing by complex means what seemingly could be done simply.”
